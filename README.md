## Introduction to Docker

**What is a Docker?**
Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker provides tools and a platform to create, manage, and deploy containers easily and consistently across different environments.

**Containers vs Vitrual Machines**
The big difference between containers and virtual machines is that virtual machines virtualize hardware whereas containers virtualize operating system kernels.

**_The Virtual Machines:_**

- Use the hypervisor to emulate real hardware
- Can take up a lot of space
- Require you to install/configure operating system
- Can run multiple apps at the same time
- Cannot interact with their hosts

**_The Containers:_**

- Do not emulate any hardware and do not need to **boot up**
- Do not require operating system installation
- Take up much less space
- Can run only one app at a time (by design)
- Can interact with their hosts

**Summary of difference between Containers and Virtual Machines**

| Containers                       | Virtual Machines          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Run in container runtimes        | Run on top of hypervisors |
| Work alongside operating systems | Need hardware emulation   |
| Do not require OS configuration  | Require OS configuration  |
| Run one app at a time(usually)   | Can run many apps at once |

**Anatomy of a Container**

**_Namespaces:_**

| Name   | Description                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| USERNS | User Lists                                        |
| Mount  | Acces to file systems                             |
| NET    | Network communication                             |
| IPC    | Interprocess communication                        |
| Time   | Abiloty to change time (Not supported by docker)) |
| PID    | Process ID Management                             |
| CGROUP | Create control groups                             |
| UTC    | Create host/domain names                          |

**Control Group Usage:**

- Monitor and restrict CPU usage
- Monitor and restrict network and disk bandwidth
- Monitor and restrict memory consumption
- ~~Assign disk quotas~~ (Not supported by Docker)

**Docker Limitations:**

- Natively only runs on linux
- Container images are bound to their parent operating systems
